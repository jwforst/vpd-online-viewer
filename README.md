# Viewportdoc Editor

Viewportdoc Editor is a document editor for creating viewport-responsive documents (viewportdocs). It uses the [codex-team editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js) as a dependency to provide excellent block-style, WYSIWYG editing. It is part of a web-app-based system that provides the means to easily create documentation integrated into a variety of pre-built templates for publishing on the web.

Publishing a viewportdoc is analogous to publishing a PDF document except a viewportdoc is based on a DOM metaphor rather than a paper metaphor. Unlike a PDF document, a viewport doc is superior for display on small mobile devices.

## Features

- Viewport documents are responsive to device viewport sizes and provide excellent usability when viewed on mobile devices, tablets, laptops, and large monitors
- Author can focus on creating content without the distraction of having to style the content, or worry about presentation
- Styling is defined by the author by selecting a template that best suits the content presentation.
- The document content and template are contained as a package, and can be saved anywhere the author desires. For example, a published viewportdoc can be saved to a local hard drive, cloud storage, or a corporate CMS.
- Reader access to the document is through the use of a free viewportdoc-reader

## Why Use ViewportDocs

Agile management practices now extend beyond software development and are proving to be a faster, better, cheaper way of managing continuous change. For example, in aerospace, compare the rate of innovation by organizations practicing Agile management to companies using traditional management practices.

Agile management requires organizations to master continuous improvement. One important key to this mastery is to provide contributors with tools that help them master the faster, better, cheaper requirement. For creating and distributing technical documentation, the ViewportDoc methodology helps technologists meet this requirement by enabling fast document turnaround, and by enabling document users with the ability to carry the documents they need in their pocket on a mobile device.
